6. CSS specificity rules
  Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element.
  The following list of selector types increases by specificity:
  0.Type selectors (e.g., h1) and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before).
  1.Class selectors (e.g., .example), attributes selectors (e.g., [type="radio"]) and pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover).
  2.ID selectors (e.g., #example).
  Inline styles added to an element always overwrite any styles in external stylesheets, and thus can be thought of as having the highest specificity.
  Although technically !important has nothing to do with specificity, it interacts directly with it. Using !important, however, is bad practice .

3. What happens once you enter url into browser? 
  1. You type maps.google.com into the address bar of your browser.
  2. The browser checks the cache for a DNS record to find the corresponding IP address of maps.google.com.
  3. If the requested URL is not in the cache, ISP’s DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server that hosts maps.google.com.
  4. Browser initiates a TCP connection with the server. (three-way handshake, SYN and ACK packages)
  5.The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
  6. The server handles the request and sends back a response.
  7. The server sends out an HTTP response.
  8. The browser displays the HTML content (for HTML responses which is the most common).

Race condition in javascript
  when two threads are accessing the same resource at the same time and modify it the result is unexpected. 
  All Javascript event handler scripts are handled from one master event queue. 
  This means that event handlers run one at a time and one runs until completion before the next one that's ready to go starts running. 
  As such, there are no race conditions in Javascript. 
  Any individual thread of execution in javascript will run to completion before the next one starts.
  Exception:When your own code causes another event to occur, the browser will sometimes call that event handler synchronously rather than waiting until the current thread of execution is done.
